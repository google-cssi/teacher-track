## SWBATs

+ Understand what constitutes an *event*
+ Attach jQuery event handlers (like 'click') to HTML elements
+ Add callback functions to event handlers
+ Use the `$(this)` selector in event handlers
+ Add animations to HTML elements using jQuery
+ Understand how to chain jQuery methods
+ Implement the jQuery UI library and other jQuery plugins
+ Parse through the jQuery documentation as a resource

## Hints and Hurdles

+ The ToDo is probably too long to finish in one session - let the students know they'll have time tomorrow to keep working on it. 
+ This is a packed day. The jQuery lecture has a lot of content, and all of the labs are challenging. As always, remember to remind students that it's okay if it's okay if it feels hard - that means they're learning!
+ Day 5 has some time built in for a review lecture, and the majority of the day will be spent on a group project, so don't worry if some concepts need to be solidified more.
